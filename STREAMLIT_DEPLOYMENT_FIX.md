# How to Fix Streamlit.io Deployment Error

The error you're seeing indicates that the Streamlit app is not starting correctly on Streamlit.io platform. This is likely due to a conflict between different dependency management files (uv.lock, pyproject.toml) and server configuration.

## Solution Steps

1. **Create a requirements.txt file**

   When deploying to Streamlit.io, rename your `streamlit_requirements.txt` file to `requirements.txt` in your GitHub repository. The file should contain:
   ```
   streamlit>=1.44.1
   pillow>=11.2.1
   pandas>=2.0.0
   ```

2. **Set the Correct Port in app.py**

   Make sure your app.py file has the following lines (not using any custom port values):
   ```python
   # Don't set a specific port in the main app.py file used for deployment
   # Instead, let Streamlit.io handle the port configuration automatically
   
   # Remove or comment out any lines like:
   # st.run(server.port=5000) or similar custom port configurations
   ```

3. **Update .streamlit/config.toml**

   Update the .streamlit/config.toml file to be compatible with Streamlit.io:
   ```toml
   [server]
   headless = true
   enableCORS = false
   enableXsrfProtection = false
   
   [theme]
   primaryColor = "#FF4B4B"
   backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
   secondaryBackgroundColor = "#F0F2F6"
   textColor = "#262730"
   ```

4. **Remove Potential Conflicts**

   In your GitHub repository, consider removing uv.lock to prevent conflicts. Streamlit.io will use your requirements.txt file for dependencies.

5. **Check for Main Branch Issues**

   Make sure your code is committed to the main branch of your repository and that app.py is at the root directory.

6. **Verify Import Statements**

   Ensure all your import statements in app.py and other files reference only modules that are either part of the standard Python library or listed in your requirements.txt file.

After making these changes, push them to your GitHub repository and redeploy your app on Streamlit.io. These adjustments should resolve the port conflict and dependency management issues.
